# makeStaticPages
makeStaticPages for RQ

run node makeStaticPages

it will write static files to the resource-center folder

many slugs do not have matches, once the client completes updating pages we will resolve

NOTE: weird caveat, HelpScout only allows a response of 50 articles max per category or collection that is why you will see I am printing to the screen the sum of articles found in each call.
